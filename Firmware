# Firmware Documentation

This directory contains the firmware for the ESP32 microcontroller that powers the Smart Energy Monitoring System.

## Overview

The firmware handles:
- Reading current and voltage sensors
- Calculating power consumption metrics
- WiFi connectivity
- MQTT communication with the server
- Local display output
- Web interface for configuration

## Development Environment

This project uses PlatformIO for development. To set up your environment:

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [PlatformIO extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)
3. Clone this repository
4. Open the project folder in VS Code
5. PlatformIO will automatically install dependencies

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Main source files
- `include/` - Header files
- `lib/` - Custom libraries
- `platformio.ini` - Project configuration

## Building and Flashing

To build the firmware:
```bash
platformio run

To upload to your ESP32:

platformio run --target upload

Configuration

The firmware can be configured by editing the 
config.h
 file or through the web interface after initial setup.
